# Advanced Architectures in LSTM Networks for Effective Management of Temporal Data

This repository is an accolade to the a Bachelor Thesis delivered to FernUniversit√§t in Hagen, Germany. The thesis was supervised by Prof. Dr. Robinson Kruse-Becher.

The main file is the "main.py" for all data processing and modelling steps.
pred_main.py utilizes the selected pre-trained model to predict the future values of the time series based on the input data of the SMARD dataset.
